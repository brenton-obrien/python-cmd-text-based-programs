# python-cmd-text-based-programs

A simple command line program written in python that uses menu structures to allow the user to navigate and execute various text based programs.
These include:

Fizz Buzz
Reverse a string
Pig Latin
Count Vowels
Check if Palindrome
Count words in a string
Journal
Vigenere/Vernam/ Caesar Cipher
Regex Query Tool.

The purpose of this program was for me to practice using a menu system, to reaffirm my knowledge in text-based programs, to practice reading/writing/editing and deleting word files,
and to learn the basics of regex queries.

If there is any suggestions please let me know.
Thankyou!
